// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 numbers together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Have a line for numerical input (such as age =, or number =).
Use IF statement to verify if the number's value is divisible by 2.
Use PRINT statement to state that the number is an even number.
Use ELSEIF statement to verify if the number's value is not divisible by 2.
Use PRINT statement to state that the number is an odd number.
  
 
// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Have a line for numerical input of the 5 separate numbers (numbers = num1, num2, num3, num4, num5).

Use + operator to calculate the sum of the 5 numbers (num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 = result).
Use the answer (the sum of the 5 numbers; result) from the previous calculation as the numerator, divided by 5 (denominator):
	(num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 / 5 = result) or (type in the sum from addition calculation / 5 = result). 
After the previous calculation, use a PRINT statement to state the answer (the average of the five numbers):
	(PRINT RESULT "This is the average of the five numbers.") 

Use IF statements to calculate the minimum and maximum of the five entered numbers:
	For example, if numerical value is <= smallest number listed (entered in line 1), then that number is the minimum number.
	If numerical value is >= largest number listed (entered in line 1), then that number is the maximum number. 
After each IF statement, use PRINT statements to describe whether the number is the minimum or the maximum number:
	(PRINT MINIMUM "This is the minimum number.") and (PRINT MAXIMUM "This is the maximum number.")
